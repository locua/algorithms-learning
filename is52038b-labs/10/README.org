#+TITLE: Algorithms & Data Structures: Lab 10
#+SUBTITLE: week of 10th December 2018

#+include: ../labsheet.org

* Setup
** Saving your work from last week
   By now you should be familiar with the operations needed to save
   your work.  Make sure you commit your work to version control
   often, and always have a backup copy, ideally remotely (for example
   in your own account on the department's gitlab installation.)
** No new code this week
   As this week's lab is devoted to finishing off all the outstanding
   pieces of work, there is no new material (other than this labsheet
   itself) to be pulled.  If you do nevertheless pull from gitlab,
   this labsheet will be in the =10/= directory alongside the existing
   directories.
* Module evaluation and feedback
  At this point in the term, you have the opportunity to leave
  feedback on this module through the anonymous module evaluation
  process.  A link to the survey is available on the main [[https://learn.gold.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=11491][learn.gold
  page for this module]].  The feedback from this process is considered
  by Department management and by the Department's Learning & Teaching
  Committee, which try to improve our teaching practices across the
  board.  Please complete your module evaluation surveys for all your
  modules, including this one, by the end of this term.
* Assessed submissions
  The remaining pieces of work this term all have a deadline of
  *16:00* on *Friday 14th December*; no extensions are possible.

  A reminder: if you have missed any assessments this term for reasons
  which are valid extenuating circumstances (/e.g./ due to
  hospitalisation or bereavement), you can be excused from those
  assessments on the condition that you have provided adequate
  evidence of the circumstances to the Student Office in 25 St James
  (or by e-mail to [[mailto:computing@gold.ac.uk][computing@gold.ac.uk]]).  If you believe that you
  have extenuation for any of this term's assignments, please would
  you let me know by e-mail so that I can check with the Student
  Office and adjust my records of your marks?
** Hash tables
   The [[https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/lti/view.php?id=613662][submission area for hash tables]], based on the [[https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=613720][sheet for lab 08]],
   is open.  A very good grade is awarded for an implementation of the
   required methods ~insert~, ~find~ and ~loadFactor~ with the
   specified collision resolution scheme; an outstanding grade
   requires in addition a robust implementation of ~delete~ and
   handling the situation where the hash table becomes full.  The
   deadline for submissions is *16:00* on *Friday 14th December*; as
   usual, you may submit more than once, and your highest score is
   retained.
** String matching
   The [[https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/lti/view.php?id=613660][submission area for string matching]], based on the [[https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=613721][sheet for lab
   09]], is open.  A very good grade is awarded for a correct
   implementation of na√Øve string matching and correctly counting
   character memory accesses in that algorithm; an outstanding grade
   requires in addition implementations of Rabin-Karp (with the
   specified rolling hash function) and Knuth-Morris-Pratt matching
   exactly as specified in lectures, along with correct counting of
   memory operations for those algorithms.  The deadline for
   submissions is *16:00* on *Friday 14th December*; as usual, you may
   submit more than once, and your highest score is retained.
** Binary trees quiz
   The [[https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/quiz/view.php?id=613726][binary trees quiz]] closes at *16:00* on *Friday 14th December*.
* Vacation
  It is important that you get a break over the vacation: please do
  rest and enjoy yourselves.  A little time spent reading, thinking,
  practicing or consolidating this term's work (by finishing or
  redoing lab implementations, reading the given sections of the
  textbooks and attempting exercises, or reviewing your quiz attempts)
  will stand you in good stead.  Lectures restart at *10:00* (note
  earlier time) on 7th January 2019!
